# PatientMonitor
App for monitoring patients (both in hospitals and at home)

## Phase 0 Branching Strategy
I was researching different branch strategies for GitHub and came across one called the Git Flow Branch Strategy. I have decided to loosly follow this strategy. I have several branches that will all be used for different purposes. 
The main branch will be used for any deployable code I have completed.
The developing branch will be used for any sections of the app that are mostly finished. 
Features branch will be used for specific features within the app as I develop them. 
Finally, the needs-fixing branch will be used for any parts of the app that I am working on that are only in the beginning stages and need a lot of work before complete. 
I have decided to use this method to organize my code because it can properly keep track of all of the stages of my code as I develop them. As I progress from needs-fixing to the developing I will merge completed code into the main branch and that will be what is ready for deployment.
